# Recommender_System
This is sample solution to a Kaggle problem. Using all the previous donations, projects and donors details build a system that can suggest donors that are most likely to donate for any given new project.

Link to original Kaggle notebook where you can find datasets too : https://www.kaggle.com/darkknight91/donors-recommender-system-word2vec/notebook

Initially I would be using project categories along with word vectors to suggest donors. Word Vectors are vector representation of words that is generated by an algorithm which trains on large corpus of text. Each word has it's own vector of dimension 100,200 or however we choos it to be. Main advantage of this is that words that are semantically similar or appear in text closely and closer to each other in vector space. Like if we build our of word vectors by training on large number of documents then vectors representing words like 'book' and 'author' would be very similar. We will exploit this to our advantage as you will see later. Since gathering such large text corpus, preprocessing and training is a time consuming task, and we already have pre-trained models available already we would be using those. Here I will be using Glove vectors which can be found in Kaggle also.

1. Build Word2Vec using pre-trained Glove vectors
2. Calculate average word vectors for all the unique categories used in the projects dataset and store it a list.
3. Given any new project, extract it's category, find the average word vector and find most similar vector from above list.
4. Once you have most similar categories, get projects tagged under those categories.
5. Finally get donors who have donated to projects found above.
